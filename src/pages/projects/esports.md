[Esports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_sports) (competitive video gaming) has been pretty big in [South Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_e-Sports_Association) for a while. The industry was worth [$1.2 billion](http://esportsdigest.com/starcraft-2/editorial-the-legitimacy-of-esports-and-the-dreamhack-open-2013/) in Korea alone last year. They have multiple cable [TV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongamenet) [channels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBCGame) dedicated to watching other people play video games, and talented players often make [six figure salaries](http://www.businessinsider.com/a-look-inside-the-earnings-of-a-top-ranked-professional-starcraft-ii-player-2012-6). Esports is also starting to grow in both the US and Europe thanks to game developers like [Riot](http://www.riotgames.com/), [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/), and [Blizzard](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/) investing their own money into big tournaments like the [League Championship Series](http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/article/season-3-league-legends-championship-series), [The International](http://www.dota2.com/international/home/overview/), and the [World Championship Series](http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en). Combined with these official venues, tournaments like [GSL](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/GOMTV_Global_StarCraft_II_League), [DreamHack](http://www.dreamhack.se/splash/), [WCG](http://us.wcg.com/), and other various events award millions of dollars every year to the best teams and players.

As an avid eSports fan, I found myself struggling to keep up with the multitude of tournaments across various games. This challenge inspired me to conceptualize eSports Tracker, a webapp designed to streamline the spectator experience in the booming world of competitive gaming.
eSports Tracker aimed to be a one-stop hub for all things eSports. The key features I envisioned included:

- Centralized Information: Aggregating tournament data from all games into one clean, simple interface.
- Personalized Dashboard: Allowing users to follow their favorite games, tournaments, teams, or players for a customized feed.
- At-a-Glance Updates: Providing quick views of the week's most important events on the main page.
- Big Picture Statistics: Tracking industry trends like prize pools, tournament frequency, and regional data.
- Spotlight on Smaller Games: Discovering exciting events for niche titles that might otherwise fly under the radar.

The goal was to create a platform where users could instantly see what was happening in the eSports world, from major league playoffs to up-and-coming indie game tournaments.

While developing the concept, I grappled with challenges like API integration and user interface design. The project was born from a passion for gaming and a desire to enhance the spectator experience. Although eSports Tracker never fully materialized, the concept reflected the growing need for better tools in the rapidly evolving eSports landscape of that time.
